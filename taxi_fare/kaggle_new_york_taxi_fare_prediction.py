# ## Prediction
# 
# #### With the Gradient Boosting Machine Model

# %%
from sklearn import datasets, metrics
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

# %%
train_num = train_Y.shape[0]
train_X = df[:train_num]
test_X = df[train_num:]

reg = GradientBoostingRegressor()
reg.fit(train_X, train_Y)
pred = reg.predict(test_X)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Output the Results

# %%
data_path = os.getcwd()
data_path += "/data/my_result/"
pred = np.array(pred)
sub = pd.DataFrame({'key': ids, 'fare_amount': pred})
sub.to_csv(data_path + 'taxi_1111_finalexam.csv', index=False) 

# %% [markdown]
# ## My Result

# ## What I have tried?
# 
# 1. 
#    I attempted to process the data because some of the latitude and longitude values were not reasonable, particularly the maximum and minimum values. However, after replacing them, the results were not as expected. 
# 
#    Therefore, based on my previous experience with the Titanic random forest, I was afraid that errors would propagate to an uncontrollable extent. 
#    
#    As a result, I chose to adopt the baseline approach.
